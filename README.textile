h1. Obsidian EPGP System

*Obsidian* is an "EP/GP loot reward system":http://code.google.com/p/epgp/ for World of Warcraft, written for "Ruby on Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/.

h2. Features

...as of right now, not much of anything.

h2. EPGP in a nutshell

EPGP means *Effort Points/Gear Points*. *Effort Points* (EP) are gained from various criteria, and each guild has their own. Typical examples can be showing up in time for a raid, killing a boss, points for every hour of raiding done, and contributing with materials for buffing flasks.

*Gear Points* (GP) are gained by looting items.

h3. Looting items

Both EP and GP are positive values. From this you then calculate the looting priority that is used when bidding on an item:

<pre>
priority = EP / GP
</pre>

The player with the highest priority wins the item, and instantly gains the GP for the item, which lowers his priority.

h3. Decay

To prevent "DKP hoarding", EPGP systems have a set *decay*, for example 10 percent weekly -- both EP and GP are affected by the decay, which reduces the values but keeps the player priorities intact. The result of the decay is that while players can reach a high EP, they will eventually reach a point where the gained EP will match the decay, putting a soft cap on how high your EP can go.
